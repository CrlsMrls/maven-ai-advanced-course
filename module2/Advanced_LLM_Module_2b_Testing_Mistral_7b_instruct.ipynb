These generational differences can impact management dynamics at various levels, including operational, team, and strategic levels. Understanding these differences and finding ways to navigate them is crucial for creating a harmonious and productive work environment.\n",

        "- Work Values: Baby boomers tend to prioritize loyalty, dedication, and hard work. They often value stability and long-term commitment to their organizations.\n",
        "- Attitudes: Baby boomers may have a more traditional approach to work, valuing hierarchy and authority. They may prefer a structured work environment and clear guidelines.\n",

For example, baby boomers experienced significant economic growth and stability, while millennials entered the workforce during times of economic uncertainty.\n",

            "At the FOMC meeting held on December 17-18, 2024, the Fed lowered the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage point to 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent. This decision was made in support of the Fed's goal of achieving maximum employment and returning inflation to its 2 percent objective. The Fed also announced plans to reduce its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities. The Committee is closely monitoring incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks to determine whether additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate are necessary."
